# BetterSelf - Telegram Bot

BetterSelf is a Telegram bot to help you reshape your mind through the repetition of certain phrases that you find inspiring and empowering.

We all come across inspiring quotes that we enjoy in the moment and forget soon after. Once you save your favorite phrases / quotes, BetterSelf will send you a random phrase from your list a few times a day (you can control the message interval, of course) to keep you inspired and motivated.

The bot is inspired by the book - [A Philosopher's Notes](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophers-Notes-Creating-Authentically-Goodness-ebook/dp/B004LROPTA/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) by author [Brian Johnson](https://twitter.com/_brian_johnson).
